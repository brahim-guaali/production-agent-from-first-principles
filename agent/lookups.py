"""Calling a service the way production needs it (stage 05).

`fetch()` retries what is worth retrying (a timeout, a dropped connection, a 5xx) with a short
back-off, checks the answer against a schema, and never raises: a lookup that still fails
comes back as a failure record (which service, what kind, how many attempts), so the graph
can route on it and the reply can say what went wrong. Until stage 04 the graph used
LangGraph's RetryPolicy, which retries well but, after the last attempt, raises and ends the
run with a stack trace.
