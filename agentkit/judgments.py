"""The things the graph asks the model: narrow questions with typed answers.

The order of steps, the approval rules, the payment and the reply are code. The model is
left with a few judgments:
  classify: a new refund request, a follow-up on an earlier answer, or something else?

  decide:   given the order, the policy, the fraud score and the history, what does the

cover the question, don't fill the gap: say a colleague will check. Explain
